* Exercise 1. (points = 32)
  Define f:R→R and g:R→R by the formulas f(x)=x+3 and g(x)=−x for all x ∈ R. Find
1. g◦f
2. g◦f^{-1]
3. g^{-1},f^{-1}
4. f^{-1}◦ g^{-1}
  


 
* Exercise 2. (points = 8)
 Consider the functions f,g: R→R defined as f(x)= x+1 and g(x)=x. Find  g ◦ f and f ◦ g.


* Exercise 3. (points = 15)

   Consider the function f: R^2 →R^2 defined by the formula f(x,y)= (xy,x^3). Find  f ◦ f.


[Hint: If you are confused, just follow the definition of function composition, that is f ◦ g (a) = f(g(a)). Here "a" can be a 2-D element (pair) such as x,y in this exercise.]
 
* Exercise 4 (points = 15)
Consider the functions f,g : Z×Z → Z×Z defined as f(m,n) = (mn,m^2), g(m,n)=(m+1,m+n). Find g◦f andf◦g. 


     
* Exercise 5 （points = 20)
 S = {x ∈ R | 0 < x < 1}

- Let U={x∈R | 0<x<2}. Prove that S and U have the same cardinality.
- Let V={x∈R | 2<x<5}. Prove that S and V have the same cardinality.


* Exercise 6 (points = 10)

 Suppose f is a function from a set X to a set Y.  and  I_Y is the identity function on Y.  Prove I_Y ◦ f = f.
