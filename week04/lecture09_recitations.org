* What 

  Preparation exercises for next week's midterm exam 

* Exercise 1

Tautaulogy, contradition, or neither of them?

- (p XOR q) /\ (p <-> q)

- (p XOR q) \/ (p <-> q)  

- (p -> q) /\ ( ~p -> ~q)   


XOR: p is true, q is false OR p is false, q is true
<->: p is true, q is true OR p is false, q is false
~p -> ~q = q -> p
  
** answer

-   contradiction
-   tautaulogy
-   neither of them


** main points

- Meanings of XOR,  <->,  ->, /\, \/,  ~
   

* Exercise 2

Consider the following statement form: (p ⊕ q) → (∼r → (p ∨ q)).

1. How many rows would you need to construct its truth table?>
   
2. How many columns would you need at least, to construct its truth table?
   
3. What is the truth value of the statement form when p = T, q = F, r = T?



** answer
   
 | p | q | r | T → T                     |
 |---+---+---+---------------------------|
 | t | t | t |                           |
 | T | F | T |      T                    |

* Exercise 3
Show (p -> q) -> r and p -> (q -> r) are *not* logical equivalent? 

p = true
  q= true
    r = is true

    r is fasle

  q = false
p = false


| p | q | r | left formula | right formula |
|---+---+---+--------------+---------------|
|   |   |   |              |               |

** answer
   p = false, q = true, r = false
   
** main points
- A and B are logically equivalent if and only if they are equal for all assignments
- To show equivalence, you need to check they are the same for all rows
- To show not equialent, you  need to find there is a row that the values ... diff


* Exercise 4
Write a negation for the following statement:
 ∃x ∃y such that  (0 < x <= y^2  < 100).
 
x<=0  OR x > y * y OR y * y  >= 100 

** answer
\forall x, \forall y, x<=0 or x <= y*y or y*y >= 100
** main points
- negation of quantifiers
- negation of predicates 
  

* Exercise 5
 
Determine if the following argument is valid:
p ↔ q
q ⊕ r
———-
∴ p \/ r

p is true --> q is true --> r is false  -> p \/ r is true

p is false ->.... -> r is true -> p \/ r is true

** answer

   It is valid. 

** main points
- know how to check validity.
