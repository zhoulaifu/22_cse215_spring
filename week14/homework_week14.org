* Exercise 1 (points = 10)

[[./fig/ex1.png]]

   Here is a diagram for a relation R on a set A. Write the sets A,  R, and R^{-1}.



* Exercise 2 (points = 20)

1. Congruence modulo 5 is a relation on the set of integers. In this relation x R y means x ≡ y (mod 5). Write out the relation R in the set-builder notation.

2. The relation < on the set A=Z as a subset R of Z×Z. Write out this relation in the set-builder notation.


* Exercise 3 (points = 70)

1. Consider the relation R = {(a,a),(b,b),(c,c),(d,d),(a,b),(b,a)} on the set A= {a,b,c,d}. Is R reflexive? Symmetric? Transitive? If a property does not hold, say why.
   
2. Consider the relation R= {(a,b),(a,c),(c,c),(b,b),(c,b),(b,c)} on the set A= {a,b,c}. Is R reflexive? Symmetric? Transitive? If a property does not hold, say why.

3. Consider the relation R = {(a,b),(a,c),(c,b),(b,c)} on the set A = {a,b,c}. Is R reflexive? Symmetric? Transitive? If a property does not hold, say why.  

4. Consider the relation R = {(0, 0), (2, 0), (0, 2), (2, 2)} on the set of integers. Is R reflexive? Symmetric? Transitive? If a property does not hold, say why.

5. Define a relation on integers as x R y if |x − y| < 1. Is R reflexive? Symmetric? Transitive? If a property does not hold, say why.

6. Define a relation on integers as x R y if |x − y| <= 1. Is R reflexive? Symmetric? Transitive? If a property does not hold, say why.       

7. Let A be the set of people living in the world today. A relation R is defined on A as follows: For all p,q ∈ A, p R q if p lives within 100 miles of q. Is R reflexive? Symmetric? Transitive? If a property does not hold, say why.
