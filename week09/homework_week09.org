* Exercise 1.  (points = 8)
State whether each of the following is true or false:
1. ø = {0}
2. x ∈ { x }
3. ø = { ø }
4. ø ∈ { ø }
   
    Let N be the set of natural numbers,  A = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}, B = {1, 3, 6, 7, 8}. State whether each of the following is true or false:
5.  4 ∉ B
6. A ∈ N
7. A  ⊆ N 
8. B  ⊆ A


* Exercise 2. (points = 6)
The following sets have been defined using the set-builder notation. List three elements of each set.
1. {x ∈ N | x = 2n - 5 for a natural number n}
2. {y ∈ N| 2y^2 < 20}
3. {z ∈ N|  3z = n^2, for a natural number n}


* Exercise 3 (points = 6)
X = {a, c} and Y = {a, b, e, f}.
Write down the elements of:
1. X × Y
2. Y × X
3. X × X



* Exercise 4 (points = 8)
Sketch Venn diagrams that show the universal set, U, the sets A and B, and a single element x in each of the following cases:
1. x ∈ A; A  ⊆ B
2. x ∈ A; A and B are disjoint
3. x ∈ A; x ∉ B; B  ⊆ A
4. x ∈ A; x ∈ B; A is not a subset of B; B is not a subset of A

* Exercise 5 (points = 12)
Make six copies of the Venn diagram shown below, and then shade the areas represented by:
1. A' ∪ B
2. A ∩ B'
3. (A ∩ B)'
4. A' ∪ B'
5. (A ∪ B)'
6. A' ∩ B'

* Exercise 6 (points = 60)
Use set laws to prove the following, stating which of the set laws you are using at each step. You can refer to the laws in the figure below.
1. B ∪ (ø ∩ A) = B
2. (A' ∩ U)' = A
3. (C ∪ A) ∩ (B ∪ A) = A ∪ (B ∩ C)
4. (A ∩ B) ∪ (A ∩ B') = A
5. (A ∩ B) ∪ (A ∪ B')' = B
6. A ∩ (A ∪ B) = A
